## Task - install the required libraries.
For this course, we will be using the [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/), [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html)
and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) libraries.

In PyCharm open the terminal - you can find the terminal icon in the left bottom corner. In the command line run
`pip install matplotlib pandas seaborn`. 

We will also be using the `kagglehub` package to download the dataset. To install it, open the terminal and run 
`pip install kagglehub`.
