## Task - reading and exploring data.
We've installed the required packages and downloaded the dataset. Before we visualize the data, we should read the file
and explore the data structure.

For this task, we'll be using the `pandas` library.

Create 3 functions: 
1. To create a `pandas` `DataFrame` from a csv file. You can use `pd.read_csv`.
2. To view first five rows from the loaded `DataFrame`.<div class="hint"> Use `pd.head()` </div>
3. To view a description of the `DataFrame` <div class="hint"> Use `pd.describe()` </div>
